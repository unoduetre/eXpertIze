The report describes ''eXpertIze'' program, which is a knowledge application software, for helping users to realize what they have in mind, fulfilling some constraints. It could be used both as a game, which allows to guess the name of an object a player has in mind by asking him/her some questions, and as a serious software module for discovering what a user has in mind when e.g. learning a language, and not remembering a word. The algorithm used is general. We focused on the game functionality.

\section{Introduction}
Let us consider the general knowledge discovery problem. The process of knowledge discovery was defined in \citet{Memon} as ''the development of new tacit or explicit knowledge from data and information or from the synthesis of prior knowledge''. Depending if an individual wants to gain explicit or tacit knowledge, possible strategies are combination of knowledge and socialization. 

Let us imagine the following situation: a user does not remember a word in a foreign language. He or she knows exactly what he or she wants to say. A knowledge discovery system could help him or her to find a proper word describing an object he or she has in mind by utilizing what he or she already knows about the thing. The same strategy could be used for the knowledge capturing process, which was defined in \citet{Memon} as ''the process of retrieving either explicit or tacit knowledge that resides within people, artifacts or organizational entities''. The difference between the two situations is the difference between the place the knowledge goes, it could be either a person or a knowledge base. In the knowledge discovery situation a person wants to gain some new knowledge. In the knowledge base situation an organization wants to transfer some knowledge from people's minds to organization's knowledge base. The source of the possibility of using the same algorithm lies in the following observation: in the presented situation a person is the source of knowledge. Nevertheless the end user of knowledge is different.

To be able to solve the problem we need to specify it further and to simplify it. The reasons for that are both time constraints and perceived difficulty of fully solving the problem. For this reason, we imagined the following scenario. A user has a material object in mind (but not \textbf{necessarily} a name of the object). By the least number of interactions with the user and by using a proper knowledge base we should be able to guess a name of the object. 
\section{Literature review}
There are two general ways of solving the problem. The first question we should as is: ''who should drive the interaction?''. The possibilities are the following: interaction should be driven ether by a user, or by a system. For user driven interaction there are many possible algorithms. The problem is very similar to the web searching problem. Let us imagine the following situation. A user has an object in mind, but he or she does not remember the name of it. By using some related queries to a web search engine he or she is possible to find a name of the object. For a way to implement this solution please consult \citet{Google}.

We decided to use the other way, which is driving interaction by the system. In this case it is the system who asks question to a user. By using this method our system is more general and we could pose the problem as a game between a user and the system. It means, that our algorithm could be used in entertainment. Because of that our problems transforms to a problem the very similar problem of 20 questions game. 20 questions was a popular american radio program airing from 1946 to 1954 (for more information consult: \citet{Radio}), but the game is based on a popular game ''Animal, vegetable or mineral?''. The problem of 20 questions game is as follows. A user has an object in mind. By asking him or her 20 questions to which he or she can answer only ''yes'', ''no'' or ''cannot tell'' we have to guess a name of the object. The only difference is the limitation to yes/no/cannot tell answers. Because each question can be transformed to a set of questions of the yes/no type the solution is not less general, but the number of questions can be much larger. We decided to pose our problem as a 20 questions game. 

As far as 20 questions problem existing algorithmic solutions are concerned the most comercially successful one is the solution patented by \citet{20Q} and used in a popular electronic device called 20Q. The algorithm used there is an artificial neural network. It maps the set of possible question/answer pairs to the set of possible objects. The main advantage of this system is a possibility of learning: the system asks a user if the answer is correct and changes the weights in neural network accordingly. The main disadvantage of the system is impossibility of influencing choices made by a system by changing knowledge base of the system. The knowledge is hidden in neuron weights and is not easily accessible for selective modification.

We decided to use a different method of solving the problem. We used Prolog programming language for implementing a knowledge base and a system operating over it. Prolog is a general purpose logic programming language used in many domains, especially in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It was created by \citet{Prolog} and implements a subset of first order logic called horn clauses, with a method of reasoning called SLD-resolution invented by \citet{SLD}. For more information about prolog please consult \citet{Prolog1}, \citet{Prolog2}, \citet{Prolog2}. As a logic programming language prolog have many advantages when creating artificial intelligence and computational linguistics programs. One of them is that it is very easy to implement reasoning in prolog programs. Another one is the database operations can be coded inside the language, and transparent database can be part of a program. These characteristics made Prolog very popular tool for creating logical reasoning programs, expert systems and other types of rule based systems. The addition of definite clause grammars to the syntax of Prolog allowed it to be used as an efficient tool in natural language processing systems. Despite the reputation of logic and rule based systems as beeing unable to implement fuzziness it is actually quite simple to do that in prolog. Because of these and other features of Prolog we decided to use it to create our system. Although \citet{20Q} states that: ''another major problem that is readily apparent in such systems is their incapability to handle inaccurate or misleading information if a player answers one question inaccurately this will cause the system to pursue the wrong branch of the decision tree leading it to the wrong answer or guess'', it was very easy to overcome this difficulty by implementing specific ''soft'' rule of reasoning. What we gained is a clear and easy to modify structure of the knowledge base, which was absent in the system based on neural networks.
